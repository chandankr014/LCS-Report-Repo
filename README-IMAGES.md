## Instructions for Insertion

To insert these images into the Word document:

1. Open the Comprehensive_AQ_Sensor_Network_Report.docx file
2. Navigate to the recommended placement location
3. Insert a new paragraph where you want the image to appear
4. Use Insert > Pictures > This Device... in Microsoft Word
5. Navigate to the img/ folder and select the appropriate image
6. After inserting the image, add the suggested caption below it
7. Adjust image size as needed (recommended: 6 inches width, maintaining aspect ratio)
8. Consider adding cross-references to these figures within the relevant text

## Image References in Text

When referring to these figures in the text, use the following format:

* "As shown in Figure X, the correlation between..."
* "The system architecture is illustrated in Figure X..."
* "Figure X demonstrates the user interface for..."

## Additional Notes

* Ensure all images are properly referenced in the text
* If some images are too large or detailed, consider placing the most important ones in the main document and moving others to an appendix
* Update figure numbers sequentially if the placement order changes
